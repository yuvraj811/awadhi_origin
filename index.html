    <!-- Chosen Palette: Royal Parchment -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed around a central tab-based navigation, allowing users to directly explore each of the three dishes (Korma, Galouti, Zarda) or the foundational concepts of Awadhi cuisine. This non-linear structure is more user-friendly than a long-scrolling report. Each dish section is a self-contained story, using a two-column layout to present quick facts alongside detailed narratives. The key interaction is the Galouti Kabab legend-switcher, which transforms a static table from the report into a dynamic comparison. This interactive, thematic approach was chosen to enhance engagement and comprehension, allowing users to compare, contrast, and dive deep into the content that interests them most, rather than being forced through a linear narrative. The 'Image Gallery' tab has been removed as per user request. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Competing legends of the Galouti Kabab's invention. Goal: Compare. Viz/Method: Interactive button-based content switcher. Interaction: User clicks a button for each legend ('The Generous Host' vs. 'The One-Armed Chef') to dynamically update the displayed text about the Nawab, chef, and story. Justification: This is far more engaging than a static table and encourages active user participation. Library: Vanilla JS and HTML/CSS.
        - Report Info: Evolution of dishes from royal to public. Goal: Show Change. Viz/Method: Simple horizontal process flow diagram. Interaction: Static visual aid. Justification: Clearly illustrates the journey of each dish without complex charts, using styled HTML and Unicode arrows. Library: HTML/CSS with Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Social status of each dish. Goal: Compare. Viz/Method: A horizontal bar chart. Interaction: Hovering over bars shows tooltips with details. Justification: Provides a quick visual summary of the dishes' primary audience (Royal vs. Public), making the information easily digestible. Library: Chart.js with Canvas.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                            <p>Awadhi culture was all about being 'nafasat' (refined) and 'nazakat' (graceful). This wasn't just for art or poems; it was the heart of their cooking. Chefs had to make dishes that tasted delicate, looked beautiful, and smelled wonderful, making every meal a special event.</p>

                            <p>The main cooking style in Awadh is 'dum,' which means cooking slowly in a sealed pot. This method was first used by Mughal armies for practical reasons, but it was perfected in royal kitchens. It made meats very tender and mixed flavors deeply, creating rich dishes that were surprisingly light and fragrant.</p>

                            <p>The Nawabs loved food very much. They held big cooking contests, offering fame and money to chefs who could invent the most special and tasty dishes. This strong, creative competition was where many Awadhi foods were born.</p>

                            <p>Recipes were kept very secret, passed down only within families of 'bawarchis' (chefs). This led to many unique dishes, but it also meant that some dishes were lost forever if a chef didn't pass on their knowledge. This makes the recipes we still have even more precious.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Korma's story starts in the 16th-century royal courts of the Mughals. It was a dish made to show off wealth and power, often using expensive ingredients like saffron and edible silver leaf. Making it was a complex art, involving quickly cooking meat in clarified butter (ghee) and then slow-cooking it perfectly. The Awadhi style made it even better, creating a thick, creamy, and rich gravy.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">There's a story about Nawab Jafar Hussain asking a cook, "What do you cook? Korma. And besides korma?" This shows how important Korma was; mastering it was a sign of a true royal chef.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Zarda was a common dish at Mughal and Nawabi celebrations. Its golden color made it a symbol of good luck and happiness. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah loved it especially during spring picnics, where he and his court would wear yellow clothes to match the dish and the season, floating on decorated boats.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">Even though it started in royal, mostly Muslim, settings, Zarda became truly Indian. Now, it's a main dish at Hindu festivals like Diwali, Sikh celebrations, and even offered at Sufi shrines. This shows how well it blended into different cultures. It's not just a dish from history; it's a sweet part of many Indian traditions today.</p>

He challenged his chefs to make a kebab so soft he could enjoy it without chewing. The brilliant chef Haji Mohammad Fakr-e-Alam Saheb created the Galouti by grinding the finest lamb into a paste and using tenderizers like raw papaya with a secret mix of spices. This kebab was not just for him; during a big famine, the Nawab even served these kebabs to the workers building the Bada Imambara, showing that even royal food could be shared with common people during hard times."

He loved arts and food, so he held a 'kebab making contest' with a big prize for the softest, most delicious kebab. A one-armed cooking master, Haji Murad Ali, won the contest. His missing arm gave him the nickname 'Tunday' (meaning one-armed), and his creation became the famous 'Tunday Ke Kebab'. He is known for making the kebab perfectly soft and melt-in-the-mouth. His family opened the well-known Tunday Kababi shop in 1905, making the dish a famous part of Lucknow."
